Conclusion:  After gathering huge amount of sensitive data, I came to know that how our sensitive data which are very important in aspects of the security for the company are easily available on the internet that can be used by the scammer and the hackers to exploit and damage the company with their bad intensions. In this we got to know about phone numbers, Gmail accounts, location, many IP addresses and their ports, few persons connected to the company, and many other things related to the company. Maltego GUI provides many tools to check these vulnerabilities if there available in our web pages. This helps to make our web pages more safe and secure and we can conduct these vulnerabilities assessments and penetration testing time to time as required.
